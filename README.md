## Portability

Suika2 runs on Windows, macOS, Web browsers, iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Switch.

Suika2 consists of the platform independent layer (PIL) and the hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
PIL is written in ANSI C, the most portable language in the world.
HAL is currently written in C, C++, Objective-C and Java.

If you would like to port Suika2 to a new target platform, you are only required to write a HAL.

FYI: We don't use SDL2 and it takes less than a week to port to platforms that do not support SDL2.

## Suika2 Pro

Suika2 Pro is a developer tool for Suika2, available for Windows/macOS/Linux.
It provides developers with a debugging capability and an export function.

## Suika2 Kirara

Suika2 Kirara is a GUI wrapper of Suika2.
It provides a capability to edit Suika2 scripts in a window with mouse operations.
If you are not familiar with scripting, please consider using it at first to get used to scripting.

**Note**: Kirara is still in beta. In addition, it is not suitable for production use.
