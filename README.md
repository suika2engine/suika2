## Portability

Official builds of Suika2 run on Windows, Mac, and Web browsers.
The source code can be compiled for iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD.
If a developer wishes, Windows and Mac versions can also be compiled from source.

Suika2 consists of a platform independent layer and a hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
The platform independent layer is written in ANSI C, the most portable language in the world.
HALs are currently written in C, C++, Objective-C, and Java.

If you want to port Suika2 to a new target platform, you are only required to write a HAL.

## Suika2 Pro for Creators

[`Suika2 Pro for Creators`](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/wiki/5.-Suika2-Pro-for-Creators) is Suika2's sister application, a visual development tool for Windows and Mac that provides developers with a debugger and package export function.
